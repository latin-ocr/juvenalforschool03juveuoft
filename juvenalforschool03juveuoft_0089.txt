wrinkles such as. where Thabraca stretches its shady gladeS, a
grandam ape scratches in her time-worn chaps. Youth from
youth are distinguished by countless marks; that is sairer than
this, and that again than another, this sturdier sar than that: the
old have one only aspect: palsy in limbs and voice, a scalp now
smooth, a nose snivelling in second childhood‚ toothless gurns
wherewith, poor soul, to mump his bread: so loathsome to wife
and sons and to his very sels, as to strike qualms into the fortune-
hunter Cossus, His palate numbed, wine and meat have no
more the relish that they once had. Turn to another organ. Sing
who may, the rarest of harpers, even Seleucus, and such as
glitter amid the choir in a suit os gold, what charm has all their
music sor ears that are deas? What odds to him, where in
the wide theatre he sits, who can scarce hear cornets or the
trumpets’ blare? ‘ under an actor’s nose he’s never near.' His

is thawed by sever only: on all hands ailments manifold muster
sor the assault3 ask me their names, Ι will sooner dispateh the
lists of matron Oppia's paramours, of patients murdered in a
single autumn by Themison’s drugs, of partners cosened by
Basilus, orphan wards by Hirrus ;—sooner will Ι rehearse the
mansions now owned by him, under whose razor my strong
beard rustled in my youth. One is seeble in the shoulder‚ one
in loins, one in hip; another, blind of both eyeS, envies those
who still have one; this man’s bloodless lips take sood with
others’ fingers; as for himself, long inured to stretch his jaws at
sight of supper, he ‘gapes and gapes and that is all‚' like the
swallow’s brood‚ to whom their mother flies with full beak, her-
self fasting. But worse still than all decay of limbs is memory's
decay, which recalls neither his slaves' names nor the friend's
features, with whom he supped but yesternight, nor those whom
he begot and bred; sor by an unnatural testament he disinherits
his own flesh and blood ; all his estate is devised to Phiale.
Grant him still sound in mind, yet he must lead out his sons to
burial, must gaze on his beloved wife's and his brother's pyre,
or urns charged with sisters’ dust. This forfeit is laid on all
long livers3 stroke on stroke lighting upon their home, they
grow old amid ‘griess always green, a household still in tears‚’
in a standing livery of black. Nestor, if we put any saith in
great Homer, was a patrem of long life second only to the crow ;
happy sure, who staved off death through three ages and already
tells the sum of his years on the right hand, and has broached
the new wine of so many seasons. But soft, stand awhile, and
hear him repining at fate's decrees, at the thread of days too
lavishly spun, when, watching his bold son Antilochus⁷ beard
