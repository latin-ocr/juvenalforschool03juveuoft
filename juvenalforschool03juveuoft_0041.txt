28-53 Now then [knowing the vanity of human wishes]
must you not praise Democritus for laughing, Heraclitus sor
weeping, when they had moved but one step from their sill?
But every man can play the censor with caustic flout ; 'tis more
marvel whence that store of brine held out for the eyes. Demo-
critus used to shake his lungs with endless laughter‚ though
Abdera had none of our Roman pomp, robes of state, lictors,
fasces, sedam, praetor's court. How if he had seen the mock
majesty os our circensian procession? the praetor standing out
from his losty car, towering high amid the dusty circus, in tunic
figured with palm leaves, borrowed from the temple of Iuppiter,
trailing from his shoulders the purple hangings of a starred toga,
and on his head a crown, whose heavy hoop no neck can sup-
port: for a public slave sweats beneath the load, slave and
consul riding in one car, that the consul may remember he is but
man? Add too the eagle, rising from the ivory wand, on that
side comets, on this citizens in snow-white gowns at the horses’
reins, a long train marching to grace the show before their
patron. whose boarded dole has bought their sriendship. Even
in days of yore every chance meeting with his kind furnished
food for laughter to him, whose wisdom proves that greatest
men, destined to leave high examples behind them, may arise in
the native home of blockheads, under a gross, foggy sky. De·
mocritus mocked the business of the crowd and its pleasures.
sometimes its very tears; while he himself bid frowm'ng F ortune
go hang, and snapt his fingers in her face.

This contrast between Heraclitus and Democritus is very
common Lucian vit. auct. 13—4, where the pair are put up
together in the sale of philosophers. Iuv. follows Sen. de
tranq. an. 15 §§ 2—3, we must bring ourselves to regard all the
faults of the vulgar as ridiculous, not as hateful, and imitate
rather Democritus than Heraclitus, hic enim, quotiens
in publicum processerat [Iuv. 29—30], flebat, ille ride-

than when thou wert alive; life is now more pitiable. Lauglz
at life, Democritus, more now than of yore, life is now more
laughable than ever. 1 myself, as I look at the two, ain puzzled
to choose between you, how to weep with thee, how with thee

are apocrypbal. No more happy example of grave mockery
could have been found than the triumpha} procession at the
games. The praetor, whose chief function was now the manage-
ment of shows, assumed the state proper to those who had
enlarged the bounds of empire. The emperor alone, or his sons
or nephews, were now permitted to triumph, but the decorations
