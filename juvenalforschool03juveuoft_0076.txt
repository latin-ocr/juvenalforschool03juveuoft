scale: how many pounds will you find in that greatest os com-
manders ? yet this is he sor whom Africa has not room,—Africa
lashed by the Atlantic main to the west, stretching eastward to
lukewarm Nile, and again southward to the Ethiopians and
their tall elephants. Spain is added to his rule, he scales the
I'yrenees: Nature reared a barrier of Alp and snow, he rends
the rock and blasts the mountain with the steam of vinegar.
Now Italy is won, yet still he pushes onward: ‘Nothing' he
eries, ‘is done, unless we storm the gates with our Carthaginian
power, and 1 plant my colours 111 mid Subura.' O what a visage,
o for a painter's canvas to do it justice, when the one-eyed
general bestrode his Gaetulian elephant! What then is his
end? O pride! why, vanquished in his turn, he posts into
banishment, and sits there a mighty retainer, the marvel of a
gaping crowd, in the lobby osa court, till his Bithynian majesty
may (leign to wake. Not swords, nor volleys of stoneS‚ nor darts.
shall quench that soul, which once embroiled the world, but
that avenger of Cannae, the poisoned ring, making amends for
floods os Roman blood. Go, madmam scour the stormy Alps,
to become the wonder of school-boys⁷ to furnish out a theme for
a speech-day show. For Pella’s youth one single globe is all too
small; he chafes, poor soul, in the narrow bounds of the
universe, as though pent in Gyara and tiny Seriphum yet, let
him once set foot in Babylon that city of brick, and a stone
coffin will satisfy his every want: death and death alone betrays
the nothingness of men’s puny frames, what dwarfs our bodies
are. Ships sailing across mount Athos. and other bold lies of
Greek history, have long passed sor truth, the sea paved by the
same navy‚ a firm roadway for wheels; we believe that deep
rivers failed and their streams were drained to the dregs as the
Mede broke his fast, and whatever else Sostratus sings and
strains himself to sing with reeking armpits. Yet in what plight
did he return, after the ssight from &flamia—he who in bar-
barian sashion was wont to storm with the lash against the
North-XVest and South-East, winds that had never brooked like
outrage in their Aeolian dungeon‚——he who had fettered earth-
shaking Neptune's self—so far relenting. no doubt, that he
did not sentence him to be branded to boot! W'ould any
god accept service under such a lord!—But in what plight‚ 1
s,ay did he return? why with one poor bark, while the waves
ran blood and the cumbered prow struggled through shoals of
corpses. Such forfeit did glory—glory sought with prayers—
wring from him.
