AD RHETORA MistT the orator was far too young (being
only 7 years of age Dem. 8¹4 9) to have entered the school os
rhetoric at his father’s death. He complains (828 5) that his
teacliers were defrauded by Aphobos3 Plut. Dem. 4§ 2 adds

rewards, who wooes bare virtue for herself? Yet their country
was long ago sunk by the pride of a few, by their itch os
applause and of an epitaph that might cleave to the stones that
guard their ashes; stones to spring which there needs but the mis-
chievous growth os the wild-fig tree, since tombs themselves
have their appointed hour of doom. Lay Hannibal in the
