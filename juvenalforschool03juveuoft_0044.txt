Flor. 1 5 ξ 6 Duker ‘from the Etruscans came the gold'en car
and four horses of our triumphs, the togae pictae tunicaeque
palmatae! Liv. xxx 15 §11——12 Scipio presents Masinissa
aurea corona (ver. 39-41)‚...scz'pz'one eburno (ver.43). toga
picta et palmata tunica, saying that Rome knew no higher
honour than a triumph, nor had triumphant generals any more
gorgeous attire. The tunica palmata was so called from the
palm-branches which, with Victories and other figures, were
worked upon it. There were two kinds of embroidery used in
Rome, the Phrygian in cross-stitch, the work of phrygiones ; the
Babylonian in satin—stitch ars plumaria, the work of plumarii:
the former corresponds to engraving by dots, ‘stippling‚' the
latter to line engraving. The tunica palmata was χρυσοποίκιλτος
or χρυσοποίκιλος (DS. XVIII 26 ἕ 4. Athen. 198⁰) a work of the
ars plumarz‘a,· the toga picta was spangled with stars, χρυσόπα-
στος, a work of the phrygiones. Nero entered Rome aster his
Grecian victories in the triumphal car of Augustus, wearing
(Suet. 2 5) a chlamys distincta stellis aureis (DCass. LXIII 20 ἓ 3
ἁλουργίδα χρυσόπαστον). On the Greek vases found in Etruria
the embroidery consists of stars, erosses, dots and round orna-
ments surrounded with dots, which were osten formed of little
spangles and leaves of gold; these spangles, the remains of the
funeral robes, have been found in graves both in Etruria and in
the Crimea.
