luet lzoc Antonius aevo. App. b. e. 1V 20 ‘then Laenas, though
he had once won an action through Cicero's advocacy, drew his
head from the litter, striking or rather sawing it three times3 so
unhandy was he. He likewise cut off the lzcznd, wherewith
Cicero wrote those orations against the tyranny of Antonius,
which in imitation of Demosthenes he called Philippics [the
same point in Plut. Cic. 48 s* 2 hotlz hands, Anton. 20§ 1 the
right hand]...Laenas, finding Antonius seated in the sorum,
waved tlte lcead and lzand while yet a long way off, by way
of displaying them. Ant. overjoyed crowned the tribune, and
gave him 250,000 Attic drachins over and above the promised
reward, as having despatched the greatest and most rancorous of
his enemies. Cicero's lzeocland lzand long hung from the
rostra, where he used to speak....1t is said that Ant. set
Cicero’s head before the table at his meai, till he had glutted
himself with the sight!
