1 3 S. the last king of Assyria, vir muliere corruptior. Arbactus,
general of the Medes‚ having with difficulty gained admission
to his presence, found him inter scortorum greges purpuras
colo nentem et muliebri habitu, cum mollitia corporis
et oculorum lascivia omnes feminas anteiret, pensa inter

On S. the conqueror, the mighty hunter, his stately palaces,
and rich library of brick books, of which fragments are preserved
in the British Museum, see Rawlinson's five great monarchies
c. 9. Modern writers place him (or them, for some make as
