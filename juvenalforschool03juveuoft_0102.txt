2⁷4 C‘ROESUM the beautiful story of the interview of Croesus
with Solon was questioned on chronological grounds in antiquity
(Plut. Sol. 27 ἓ 1); as reported by Hdt., it cannot have taken
place; though the two may have met at another time3 the
travels of Solon lasted from B.C. 593—5S3; Croesus came to the
throne B.C. 5603 however DL. 1§§ 50. 62 and Suid. speak of
later travels; Solon died in Kypros. Duncker accepts the story
in the main, and dates the interview Rc. 560 or 559. M. Sen.

276—282 from Vell. 11 19 B.C. 88 ‘Sulla returned to Rome,
occupied it by force of arms, and drove out from the city twelve
ringleaders of revolution, among whom were Marius with his
son and P. Sulpicius, ac lege lala exules fecit3 . . . Marius
after his sixth consulship and his 70th year, naked and over-

was dragged forth from a bed of reeds hard by the swamp of
Marica, wherein he had concealed himself when flying from the
pursuit of Sulla's cavalry. A halter being thrown over his neck,
he was led to the prison of tlze Mmturnmsz'ans by order of the
duumvir. A public slave, a German by nation‚ was sent with a
sword to dispatch him; it chanced that this slave had been taken
