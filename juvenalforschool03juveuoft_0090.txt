blazing in the funeral flame, he asks every comrade abou·¹ him,
why he lasts to these years, what he ever did to deserve so lin-
gering an age? So Peleus murmured, while he mourned
Achilles untimely snatched away, so Laertes, whom nature bids
lanient the storin-tost Ulixes. While Troy was yet secure,
Priam would have made his last progress to the shade of¹ Assa-
racus in royal state,—Hector and his other sons shouldering the
hearse amid weeping daughters of Ilium, so that Cassandra
might lead their wailing with beaten breast and Polyxena with
her robe rent,—if only he had died before Paris began to build
his dariug keels. What then did Priarn win by the long respite?
He saw a general wreck, all Asia crumbling under fire and
sword. Then doffing his diadem, he took arms, a tottering sol-
dier [‘a soldier half, and half a sacrifice’] and dropt down be-
fore the altar of high Iuppiter, like some decrepit steer, which.
disdained long since by the thankless plough, tamely yields to
his master's knife a neck lean and pitiable. Yet that was at
least a human death3 his queen outlived him, but only to glare
grimly and snarl with a true cur's grin [‘survived a bitch and
barked away her life’J. I hasten now to Rome, passing Mith-
radates by, and Croesus, whom righteous Solon’s eloquent voice
charged to regard the closing evening of a long life. Banish-
ment, jail, Minturnae’s fens, the bread of beggary in vanquished
Carthage,—all these lapse of days brought upon Marius. What
would nature ever have engendered on earth, or what Rome,
happier than that her citizen, if only he had straightway breathed
out his victorious soul, after heading the processioa of prisoners
and all the pageant of his wars, in the act of alighting from his
Teutonic car? Campania in her forethought had sent Pompeius
severs sor which he had done wisely to pray3 but many cities
and their state prayers prevailed to save him3 so his fortune and
the city’s struck off after his defeat the head thus reprieved.
This torture Lentulus escaped, this punishment Cethegus, and
fell unmangled; nay, Catiline on the battle-field lay with corpse
entire.
