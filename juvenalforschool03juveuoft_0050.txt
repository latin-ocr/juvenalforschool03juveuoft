Capitol for sacrifice a tall and whited ox: for ’tis a general
holiday3 Seianus is drawn along the strects by the hangman’s
hook, a public show; not a man but rejoices over him. ‘ What
lips he had, what a haughty sace! if you trust me, Ι never could
abide the man: but under what charge was he cast? who was
the informer? by what approvers, by what witness did he make
good his case?' “ Nothing of this z a long and wordy despatch
arrived from Capreae.'’ ‘Good ε if Caesar writes, I ask no more.'
But what does the throng of Remus? It sides with fortune, as
ever, and hates those on whom sentence has gone forth. The
same people‚ if Nortia had smiled upon her Tuscan, if the
emperor's age had been crushcd off his guard, would this very
hour proclaim Seianus Augustus. Long ago, since we ceased to
have votes to sell, it shook off state cares: once it granted
commands, fasces, legions, what it pleased3 now it narrows its
ambition, and dotes on two boons alone, bread and the shows.
‘1 am told that many will die.’ “No doubt of it; a great
furnace is heated3 Brutidius met me at Mars' altar, and my
friend was pale. How Ι sear, lest Aiax take vengeance on
Brutidius for his defeat, as due to his sorry pleading. Let us
run at full speed, and while yet he lies on the bank, trample on
Caesar’s foe. But let our slaves be there to see our loyal zeal,
lest any denying it, collar his master and drag him quaking for
sear to the bar.’⁷ This was then the talk, these the whispers οἵ
the crowd respecting Seianus. would you be courted as
Seianus was? be master of his wealth, and bestow on one curule
ehairs of highest rank, on another the charge of armies? be
counted guardian of an emperor perched with his wizard crew
on Capreae’s narrow cliff? you would at least wish to have
pikes and troops at command, young nobles on your staff, a
guard quartered in your house ? why should you not? even they
who lack the will to kill, would fain enjoy the power. Yet
what glory or success can make you content with joy 601111161-
poised by trouble? would you choose the robe of state of him
whose corpse is now dragged in scorn, or be a country mayor of
Gabii or Fidenae, passing sentence 011 false weights‚ an aedile in
tattered tunic at deserted Ulubrae, breaking short measures?
You confess then that Seianus mistook the true objects of desire;
for while coveting excessive dignities and grasping at excessive
wealth, he was but rearing the numerous stages of a lofty tower‚
from which his fall might be from the greater height, and his
crash once set in movement, might be from a more appalling
steep. What overwhelmed the Crassi, what the Pompeii, and
that Caesar who tamed the Quirites and brought them under the
lash? Why, ambition that spared no means to secure the
highest place, and aspiring prayers heard and granted by heaven’s
