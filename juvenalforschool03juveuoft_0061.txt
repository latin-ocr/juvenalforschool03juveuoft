them the sn'ends of S. who had abused their greatness; the
praetorians, jealous os the confidence shewn to the wgriles, set
fire to houses and fell to pillage. Those who had courted S.,
those who had accused or borne witness against others to please
him, were panic-stn‘cken. ib. 14 his relations. friends. flatterers,
and those who had moved the senate to vote him honours, were
put on their trial; some who had been acquitted were again
tried, on the ground that they owed their escape to his sav0ur;
the mere fact that one had been a friend os S. stood in lieu os
all proos of guilt; his own creatures endeavoured to screen
themselves by accusing others. ib. 15 ἐξ 1—3 most of the
accused committed suicide. Senators and knights and ladies
were crowded into the carcer. and either despatched there or
thrown headlong from the Capitol. ib. 16 ἓξ 5-7 guilty and
innocent suffered alike. Once Tiberius declared that any one
was free to mourn sor S.; but shortly afterwards the executions
were resumed. ib. ¹9 some friends of S. were spared, as L.
Seianus the praetor and M. Terentius a knight‚ who boldly
avowed his friendship sor the fallen favorite, and defended it by
the example os Tiberius. ib. ²5 ἐξ ²-4 A.1>. 35 Fulcinius Trio,
who served S. as an informer, anticipated condemnation by
suicide.
