LVII! 9 Tiberius wrote to Naevius Sertorius Macro appointing
him prefect of the praetorians; he prepared Memmius Regulus
one of the consuls (the other was a creature of S.) and Granicus
Laco commander of the night police. Meeting S. troubled at
not hearing from Tiberius, he privately assured him that the tri-
bum'cia potestas was designed for him. NVhen S. had entered
the senate-house (in the temple of Apollo Palatinus), Macro dis-
missed the praetorian guards of S. and the senate to their camp,
shewing his commission and promising them a largess. He re-
placed them by vzffiks, delivered the letter to the consuls, and
proceeded to the praetorian camp. ib. 10 Meanwhile the letter
was read; it was long: no continuous attack on S., but first
some other topic, then a few words of censure, then another in-
different matter, then further censure. At the close it declared
that two senators connected with S. ought to be punished, and
he himself kept in custody. There was no downright‘sentence
of death on S., T. fearing an outbreak. In order to secure him-
self on the way to Rome, T. summoned one of the consuls to
his presence [cf. Tac. an. VI 2. Suet. Tib. 65]. Before the
letter was read, S. was greeted with plaudits and congratulated
on the prospect of the tribunicia potestas. As the reading went
on, perplexity and confusion seized the senators: praetors and
tribunes surrounded S. Regulus called him, but he did not obey3
not from contempt, for he was cowed, but from being unused to
receive orders. When Regulus a third time, stretching out his
hand, cried, Seianus, come lcitlzem· he meekly asked ‘Do you can
me?' and rose from his seat. The senate with one mouth re-
viled him: yet because of his many adherents Regulus did not
venture to put the question of his condemnation to the general
vote, but asked a single senator whether he should be cast into
prison3 and so with Laco and the other magistrates led him to
the carcer. Suet. Tib. 65 spe cffnitatis ac tribunzkiae potcstatis
deceptum inopinantem criminatus est pudenda miserandaque
oratione. The style of Tiberius was by nature or habit ob-
scure and hesitadng, and especially ambiguous when he desired
