86—46 A locus classicus on the procession, pompa, at the Cir—
censian games 81 n.; another on the games themselves XI 193—
202. The ludi Romani, l. Alegalenscs (Χι ¹93 n.), l. magni, and
probably the Cerealia and all l. votivi (as well as l. sollemnes in
the circus maximus) were opened by the proccssim, which, set-
ting out from the Capitol, crossed the gaily decorated sorum, the
vicus Tuscus and sorum boarium. through the middle gate of the
circus and round the furthest metae DH. vu 72. The road was
strewn with flowers Ov. tr. 1v 2 50. The presiding magistrate
led the way, if he were a praetor or consul, standing on a lofty
chariot drawn by white horses (Apul. mag. 22) crowned with
[aurel (Ov. tr. 1v 2 22. ex P. 11 1 58. Mart. vu 8 8). He
wore the garb of a triumphant general (xx 194—5 sz'nzz'lquue tri-
umpho Ι praeda caballorum praetor sedet), the broad solds of the
gold-worked purple toga over the tunic embroidered with palm
leaves, bearing in his hand the ivory sceptre with the eagle. A
gold crown os oak leaves, set with jewels‚ was held over his head
by a public slave. His children sat, as in a triumph, in the cha—
riot or on the horses (Tac. ann. ΧΠ 41 in games given by Clau-
dius Britannicus appeared in the praetexta, Nero in triumpha}
costume). Before the praetor flutes and horns played‚ and
clients in their white gowns escorted him. Images of the gods,
aceoutred with their exuviae or attributes, were borne on biers‚
fercula, thrones and cars, tensae, drawn by mules, horses and
elephans, and escorted by companies of priests and religious
orders: nor were images of emperors wanting. The procession
was welcomed by the people standing, with shouts, invocation
of the gods and clapping of hands Ov. amor. 111 2 4 3—62. Yet
as it delayed the sports, it was viewed with impatience M. Sen.
