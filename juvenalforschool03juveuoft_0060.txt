CENSES VII 174 n. the importation of corn from Sardinia.
Sicily, provincial Africa and Egypt, with the regulation of the
market price and the free gifts of corn or money, to which the
dangerous city population (containing more than half a million
of paupers) was accustomed, caused a great drain on the state
exchequer. In the monumentum Ancyranum c. 15 Augustus
records his generosity in this matter, as in that of games c. ἐἰ
see Mommsen ad loce. The combination panem ct circenses
was proverbial. DChrys. or. 3² Ι 668 R ‘it is reported that
some one once exclaimed: What can one say of the populace
of Alexandria, who only need to have bread z'n good store
provided for thern, and a spectacle of borses, as caringfor
nothing else ,θ’ Fronto princ. hist. ad fin. p. 210 Naber ‘It
appears to be a consummate stroke of policy in the emperor not
to neglect even actors and the other players of stage or circus
or amphitheatre‚ as knowing populum Romanum duabus
praecipue rebus, annona et spectaculis, teneri.'
