account of Mithradates V1 Eupator (cir. Rc. 130-†63‚ the year
of Cicero's consulship) in Mommsen's history. If he shared with
Priam etc. the sorrow of losing wife, brother, sister, and children
before his death, the fault was his own, for many of them died

and fleet of foot‚ restless in enterprise, he fought in the thickest

where his forces held out at Athens against Sulla, B.C. 86, one
of the most memorable of sieges. In his three wars with the
Romans he encountered Q. Oppius, L. Cassius, M’. Aquilius,
Sulla, Fimbria, Murena, Cotta, Fabius, Triarius, Lucullus,
Pompeius; and formed an alliance with Sertorius. From his
last battle with the Romans at Nikopolis 13.C. 66 he fled with
