combed to-day in special honour of the feast. The one is a

and a modest blush, that would become sreeborn wearers of

his mother and eottage home and old friends the kids. His
skin is still smooth without help of art; his voice not yet
broken. The wine he hands to you was bottled on his native
hills; he is the grape’s own countryman.
