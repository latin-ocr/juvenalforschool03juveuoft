Plin. h. n. 111 §82 an island off the coast of Campania, 8 m. p.
distant from Surrentum, 11 in circuit, Τι’ὸεν i pr incipis arce
nobiles Capreae, now Capri. Augustus obtained it from the
Neapolitans, in exchange for Aenaria, and built upon it (Strabo
248. DCass. L11 43 ἓ 2 B.C. 29. Suet. Aug. 92). Tiberius
had been accustomed to seclusion at Rhodes (Tac. an. 1 4. 1v
57), and several motives combined to induce him, in aecordance
with a project long entertained (ib. 111 31. 37), to retire from
Rome, never to return (as the astrologers foretold) in the autumn
of A.D. 26 ib. 1v 57—8. 64. 74. Suet. 39. DCass. Lv111 1 ἕ 1.

the imputations against him attiibuted by witnesses to accused
persons (ib. IV 42): finally Seianus recommended him to take
his ease Tac. an 1v 41. 57. Α. D 27 he took up his residenee
there: the difficulty of access, the view, the climate eooled by
seabreezes in summer, sheltered from the cold winds in winter,
all combined to make the place attractive Tae. an. 1v 67. From
the land, separated by a channel 3 m.p. broad (ib.), it looks like
one mass of steep rock from 1000 to 2000 st. high, but the inte-
rior produces corn‚ vines, olives, figs, oranges, almonds. Re-
mains of villas and numerous antiquities have been discovered in
modern times.
