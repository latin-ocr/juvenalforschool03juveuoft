advisers of Ptolemy Dionysos (Cleopatra's brother, a boy of 13),
the eunuch Pothinos‚ the general-in-chief Achillas and the
Chian sophist Theodotos, resolved to kill P.; Plut. Pomp. 77 ὅ 3
‘ a dead man‚’ said the sophist with a smile, ⁶ does not bite.' ib.
78—80 Achillas, with the tribune Septimius and the centurion
Salvius, put off in a small boat to receive P.; who on passing
from his vessel quoted Sophokles‚ ‘he who goes to a tyrant, is
his slave3’ in the boat he conned over the Greek speech which
he intended to address to the young king. As he rose to leave

’ the boat, he was stabbed, his head cut off and the body flung

naked out of the boat, to feast the eyes of the curious. When all
had gazed their fill, a faithful freedman Philippos (with Servius
Corvus a former quaestor of P. Luc. vul 714 seq.) gathered
fragments of a fishing boat, enough at a pinch to fumish a pyre
sor a corpse naked and not entire (νεκρῷ ’γυμνῷ καὶ οὐδὲ ὅλῳ
Iuv. 288 cadavere toto). The head was presented to Caesar
when he arrived a few days later (cf. Plut. Caes. 48 ἓ 2). The
‘remains’ were sent to Cornelia and buried by her in her
husband‘s Alban estate. The tragical end of such unpre-
cedented greatness powersully impressed the Roman imagina-
tion. Prop. 111=1V 11 34—5 totiens nostro splemplzi cruenta

and his men sent the head of P. to Caesar, in hope of reward;
the body ‘some one’ buried on the sand, and erected a cheap
tomb over it; Hadrian extemporised an epitaph (cf. DCass. LXIX

to light the tomb, then buried in sand, and restored the brazen
statues which the friends of P. had erected. The site of
the tomb was Ostracine Solin. 34 ἓ 1, near mt. Casius and
