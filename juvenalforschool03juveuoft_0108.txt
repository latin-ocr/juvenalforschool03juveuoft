289—345 With low whisper, at sight of Venus’ temple, the
eager mother craves beauty for her boys, for her girls aloud,
even to a very daintiness of desire. ‘Yet why rebuke?' she
asks; ‘ Latona's self takes pride in her fair Diana.’ Yet
Lueretia’s fate forbids the wish for features like Lucretia'53
Verginia would fain take Rutila’s hump, giving Rutila in ex-
change her own faultless shape. Still greater dangers await the
beau: a blooming son keeps his parents on the rack with sear:
so seldom is beauty mated with chastity. [⁴ chaste is no epithet
to suit with fair’]. Though the plain horne, taking after the
ancient Sabines‚ may have handed down from sire to son spotless
mannerS, though boon Nature may have done her part, dealing
with liberal hand chaste affections and a sace flushed with modest
blood (for what more can Nature bestow on a boy, Nature
mightier than every keeper and every safeguard?)‚ still the well—
favoured youth may never be man; for the seducer's lavish
’ lrardihood is bold to bribe the very parents to their children's
sin : such trust have they in the power of gists. Go to now, and
rejoice in your spruce youth, whom greater perils await: he will
turn adulterer general to the city and will fear vengeance, such
as a wrathsul husband may take, nor will be a luckier gallant
than Mars that he should never be entrapped. Sometimes
however that indignation takes more lieence than any law has
allowed to indignation 3 one stabs the paramour to death,
another draws blood with the lash. But your Endymion, I say,
will prove the adulterer of a wedded dame whom he loves; pre-
sently‚—when Servilia comes, money in hand‚—0f one whom
he loathe53 he will strip her of all her bravery. But what
harm does beauty to the chaste? nay, what good had Hippo-
lytus of his temperate resolve, or what Bellerophon? For
Stheneboea and Cretan Phaedra alike reddened as scomed by
this rebuff, both took fire, both shook for rage: when shame
goads hate, then it is that a woman is most ruthless. Choose
what advice you think best for hirn whom Caesar's 'wife is bent on
wedding in her husband’s lifetime. The fairest at once and best
