LV111 11 §3 4—6 in the first instance, aster the reading of the
verbosa epistula, S. was led to the carcer: the same day the
senate met in the temple of Concord near the carcer, and seeing
the temper of the people‚ and the quiescence os the praetorians,
sentenced him to ‹leath; so he was executed and cast down the
steps ..... His children also were slain in accordance with a
decree, the daughter, who was betrothed to the son of Claudius,
having first been violated by the executioner, because a virgin
could not without impiety be killed in the prison [cf. Suet. Tib.
61. Tac. an. Vl 1 ξ 4]. His wife Apicata was not indeed con-
demned, but when she heard that her children were dead, and
saw their carcases on the steps, went home, and put an end to
her lise. Tac. an. V125 death of Agrippina, 18 Oct. 33. on
which day two years before S. had died ; the senate decreed a
yearly offering to Iuppiter Capitolinus on the day, and Tiberius
boasted that he had sorborne to strangle her and cast her out
on the Gcmom'ae cf. Suet. Tib. 53.

in his greatness (Iuv. xlv 3²5)-

ΑΔ). 31 a friend of S.‚ on the point of dying by his own hand,
says: he [Tiberius], who had taken S. as his colleague and son-
in-law‚ forgives himself ; ceteri, quem per dedecora fovere, cum
scelere insectantur. miserius sit ob amicitiam accusari, an
amicum accusare, lzaud decreverim. ib. 8 M.Terentius in like
manner consessed his friendship sor S. ea tempestate qua Seiani
amicitiam ceteri falso exuerant. DCass. LV111 10 ἓ 4
when the verbosa epistula was read, some of those who sat near
S. rose up, not caring to share the same seat with him, whose
friendship they had but just before prized. ἓ 7 aster the whole
was read they railed at him, some from sear and to cloke their
friendship. ib. 12 §3 2—3 the soldiers seeing themselves sus-
pected in regard of their devotion to S„ fell to arson and pillage
...Nor was the senate calm; they wlzo lzad courted S. were sore
troubled for sear af punishment ,· they who had aceused or borne
witness against some, whose ruin they suspected was due not to
, Τ. but to S., were filled with dismay. Very few felt assured.
