SENECAE PRAEmvxris nomos Tac. xv 64 fin. (of Seneca)
praedives ct prae-porcus. In his tract on happiness, addressed
to his brother Gallie, Seneca represents his enemies as contrast-
ing his srugal precepts with his sumptuous lise vit. beat. 17 ἓ 2
seq. ⁴ why do you not dine by your own rule? why have you
handsome sumiture? wine made before you were born ? . . . why
have you estates beyond sea, more than you have ever seen? . . .
more slaves than you can recollect?‘ A.D. 55 some blamed
Seneca and Burrus, viros gravitatem adscvcrantcs, sor dividing
houses and country mansions among them as so much booty
Tac. XI11 18. Α, D. 58 P. Suillius askcd (Tac. xm 4²) ‘by what
philosophie rule Seneca had, in four years of imperial' favour,
amassed 300,000‚000 sesterces? At Rome he swept up as in a
drag-net bequests and orbi, and drained Italy and the provinces
[e.g. Britain DCass. Lxu 2] by exorbitant usury.’ Α. D. 62
Seneca was accused (Tac. XIV 5²) of still adding to wealth
already exceeding a private standard, of ambitious designs, and
of outdoing the emperor himself in the splendour of his parks
and country houses, hortorum amoenitate et villarum magnifi-
centia. Sen. to Nero (ib. 53): ‘You have heaped upon me
such an abundance of offices and wealth‚ that nothing is wanting
to my good fortune but to moderate it. . . . Yon have surrouncled
me with boundless treasures, so that Ι often ask myself, Do J, a
man qs equestrian and provincial family, take rank with the
noblest of tlte rcalm ? . . . . wlzere is tlzal spirit satisfied wz'tlz α
modest fortune? does it lay out such parles as these, tales hortos
extruit, and stalk through these suburban estates, and run riot in
so vast terhtories, suclz boundlcss reveuucs? The only excuse
that presents itself is (cf. Sen. de ben. 11 18) that I was not free
to reject gifts from your hand.’ He begs (c. 54) to be relieved
of the burden which oppresses him; he would gladly devote to
the improvement os his mind the time now set apart sor the ma-
nagement of his property, quod temporis hortorum aut villa-
rum curae seponitur. Nero replies (c. 55) ‘what you have done
sor me will abide with me till death3 what you have received
from me, horti, et finus et villae, is all at the mercy of
chance. . . . I am ashamed to name freedmen, who are seen
richer than you. 1 blush to think that you do not excel all the
world in fortune, as you do in worth.' In short he refused to
relieve Seneca of his wealth (c. 56. Suet. Nero 35); who how-
ever changed his course of lise, holding no more leve'es, and
keeping close within doors. Λα). 62 (Tac. X1v 65) he was sus-
pected of treasonable correspondenee with Piso. After the fire
of Rome, ΑΛ). 64, he made over his riehes to Nero, as a con-
tribution to the expenses of rebuilding the city (DCass. Lxu ²5
