MALE DEFESSUS the contest between A. and Ulixes sor the arms
of Achilles was a commonplace of rhetoric VII 115 consedere
duces: sm'gis tn pallidus Aiax. Brutidius must also have
espoused the side of A. in this controversy: he passes along pale
for sear of the mighty surnace which devoured S.; but the
speaker in the text seigns concern for his clear friend (meus),
threatened with the vengeance of A.‚ whom he has so feebly de-
fended in the schools (Madvig; Hertzberg adds that Brutidius
may have been one of those who timidly raised their voice on
behalf of S. in the senate3 S. is the A. ill-defended, who
avenges himself on his lukewarm advocate, gloating over his
terror from the other world).

S. recommended Tiberius to retire from Rome, lest by forbid-
ding the crowds which thronged his house, assiduos in domum
coetus arcendo, he might weaken his influence, or by permitting
them, awake suspicion. Again, all approach to the emperor
would be through him3 he would escape envy by ceasing to hold
morning 16νέ65, adempta salutantium turba, and would by
sacrificing the shadow of power seize the substance. ib. 74
