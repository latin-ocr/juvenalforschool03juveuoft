PORTA vm 160 n.

SYENES Assouan, a frontier fortress in Southem Egypt, held
by three cohorts Strab. 797. Hence porta may be the gale of
the town, through which all traffic from Aethiopia, e.g. N ubian
ivory, must pass. Others, since the valley of the Nile is greatly
narrowed below Syene, understand by porta the pass thus formed.
The lives of Iuv. (n. 1 and 2 Jahn) seem to imply that he was
banished to this town (missusque ad praefecturam cohortis in
extrema Aegypti parte tendentis). Here were the quarries of
Syenite marble, which supplied Egypt with its statues and obelisks.

125 MAURO onscumon mnus v 53 nigri...Mauri. The
two kinds of elephants were distinguished by the ancients (cf.
sat. x 150 n.) and the African was found much further north
than now Plin. V111 ἕ 32 elephantos fert Africa ultra Syrticus
solitudines et in Mauretania ....... sea' maximos India. Stat. s.
111 3 94—5 Indi Ι dentis lzonos. Mart. Χ 98 6 citrum vetus
Indicosque dentes.

OBSCURIOR INDUS Apul. fl. 1 6 Indorum non aeque miror
eboris stmes,...nec quod isdem Indis ibidem silis ad nascenlem
diem, tamen in corpore color noctis est. Luc. 1v 679 680
concolor Indo Ι Maurus.

126 DEPOSUIT has shed. The elephant has six grinders on
each side of each jaw ; those towards the front grow first and are
worn, and then the others in turn corne into use. Iuv. in the
tone of Pliny (e.g. ΧΠ ἓ 2) or Seneca is lashing the deliciae of
the age; instead of using homegrown timber, men import at vast
eost ivory, the mere resuse of a monster from Barbary.
