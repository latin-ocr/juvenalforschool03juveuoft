ΜΕΝ pray for eloquence, strength, wealth‚ and thus invite
their own ruin upon themselves (1—27). Well might Democri-
tus and Heraclitus in this vanity of human wishes find matter,

been well sor Cicero, if he had only been known as the meanest
of poets: sor Demosthenes, if he had never lest his father’s
smithy (ιη-132). How passing is military glory‚ and how
uncertain military power, appears in Hannibal and Xerxes;
Alexander, for whom the world was all too strait‚ found rest at

all mist of error. For what do we with reason sear, covet with
reason? what do you undertake with foot so right, with a start
so lucky, but you rue your attempt and the success of your
desire? Whole houses have fallen on their own petition, when
indulgent gods have taken them at their word. In peace, in
