AT the time of the Megalesian games (193), early in April,
Iuv. invites his friend Persicus to a frugal dinner.

The rich epicure is admired; the poor, derided: our house-
keepjng and our whole plan of life should be in just proportion
to our means (1—38). ¹Many, it is true, neglect this golden rule3
they riot for a while at Rome, and then retire to Baiae, to avoid
their creditors (38—55).

'so-day, my friend, you may judge whether I practise the
frugality which Ι preach3 whether Ι live like the worthies of
those good old times when heaven itself guarded our city (56
—119), or, like their pampered descendants, can relish no meal
but such as is served ou the costliest tables, by the most expert
and elegant slaves (120—161). Let richer men enliven their
seasts by voluptuous songs and dances: here you may listen‚ is
you will, to Homer or his rival virgil (162—182).

Leave then all care behind you; leave to younger men the
dissipation of the Circus, and spend the festival with me in

1—23 the cost of our table must be proportioned to our
means ; what is due state in Atticus, is stark madness in Rutilus.
Many men waste their estate in dainty living, till at last they
are sain to enlist as sword-players, and put up with the hodge-
podge of the trainer's barrack.
